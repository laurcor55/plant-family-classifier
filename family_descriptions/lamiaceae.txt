==Description== ===All '''' species=== All four thornmint species are aromatic annual wildflowers native to the state of California in the US. The species have square stems that are erect growing. The leaves are petioled with leaf veins conspicuous and the leaf margins are often spiny. The inflorescences of the '''' genus are described as "head-like, in terminal clusters" by the genus authority James D. Jokerst.<ref name="Jepson">''Jepson Manual'', [[University of California]] Press (1993)</ref> The flowers of this entire genus are like, most mints, two-lipped forming a tube with five sepals and the stamens enclosed within the [[zygomorphic]] corolla. The [[bract]]s in the inflorescence have marginal spines,<ref name="Jepson"/> thus the basis of the common name 'thornmints'. All '''' have the upper three lobes of its calyx acuminate and the lower two lobes oblong in shape; furthermore, all '' corollae'' are funnel shaped and white with occasional tinting of purple.  Each '''' species has four stamens, with the upper two reduced. Thornmint styles are slender and their fruit is ovoid in shape with a smooth exterior texture.  ==='' ''=== ''A. '' has a stem which is generally unbranched and less than twenty centimeters in length; the stem may present short hairs or none at all. Leaves of this species are eight to twelve millimeters in length, [[lanceolate]] to [[obovate]] in shape.  The margins of this spiny leaf are occasionally [[Leaf#Margin (edge)|serrate]]. The terminal inflorescences have bracts of about five to eleven millimeters; moreover, these bracts are [[Glossary of botanical terms#ovate|ovate]] and green at the flower, with five or seven marginal spines, each three to seven millimeters. The virtually hairless to sparse short haired [[Sepal|calyx]] is five to eight millimeters in length, while the corolla is 12&nbsp;to 16&nbsp;millimeters in extent. The white [[Corolla (flower)|corolla]] is often tinged lavender in color; the corolla throat is cream colored and its upper lip is hooded, while the longer lower lip is reflexed and three-lobed. The upper lip is more diminutive than the lower, and is entire and shallowly hooded. The flower bracts are broadly ovate in shape with puberulent hairs and shiny. The bracts have seven to nine spines each. The [[anther]]s are short and hairy. The style is [[glabrousness (botany)|glabrous]]. Plants bloom in April into late June, with each flower when fertilized producing four nut-like seeds. Plants are self-fertile.

The flowers of '''' are bilaterally symmetrical, funnel shaped, blue or bluish-violet  to lavender, and grow in opposed clusters of two or three flowers in the leaf [[axil]]s on the upper part of the stem or near the tip. It usually flowers in the spring.  '''' thrives in moist shaded areas, but also tolerates sun very well. It is a common plant in grasslands and wooded areas or wasteland.  It also thrives in lawns and around buildings since it survives mowing. Part of the reason for its wide spread is its  [[rhizome|rhizomatous]] method of reproduction.

The leaves are simple, opposite in arrangement, lanceolate to ovate with crenate to serrate margins, and the blades are 5 to 8&nbsp;cm long and 3 to 5&nbsp;cm wide.  Characteristic to this species, the leaves have a soft pubescence with glandular and non-glandular hairs on both surfaces.  As the common name suggests, the [[inflorescence]] are large at 2.6 to 3.5&nbsp;cm long; flowers are terminal and blue and white in color.  Another characteristic specific to this species and used to distinguish it from other ''[[]]'' species is that the inflorescence lack an annulus within the corolla tube near the top of the calyx; this is the only species of  Section Annulatae that is exannulate. Flowers bloom from mid-May to June, and fruits mature in June and early July.<ref>•U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 2002.

==Description== Lamb's-ears are [[herbaceous]] [[perennial plant|perennial]]s, usually densely covered with gray or silver-white, silky-lanate hairs. They are named lamb's ears because of the leaves' curved shape and white, soft, fur-like hair coating. Flowering stems are erect, often branched, and tend to be 4-angled, growing 40–80&nbsp;cm tall. The leaves are thick and somewhat wrinkled, densely covered on both sides with gray-silver colored, silky-lanate hairs; the undersides are more silver-white in color than the top surfaces. The leaves are arranged oppositely on the stems and 5 to 10&nbsp;cm long. The leaf [[Petiole (botany)|petioles]] are semiamplexicaul (the bases wrapping halfway around the stem) with the basal leaves having blades oblong-elliptic in shape, measuring 10&nbsp;cm long and 2.5&nbsp;cm wide (though variation exists in cultivated forms). The leaf margins are crenulate but covered with dense hairs, the leaf apexes attenuate, gradually narrowing to a rounded point.  ===Flowers=== The flowering spikes are 10–22&nbsp;cm long, producing [[wikt:verticillaster|verticillasters]] that each have many flowers and are crowded together over most of the length on the spike-like stem. The leaves produced on the flowering stems are greatly reduced in size and subsessile, the lower ones slightly longer than the interscholastic and the upper ones shorter than the verticillasters. The leaf [[bracteole]]s are linear to linear-lanceolate in shape and 6&nbsp;mm long.  The flowers have no [[Pedicel (botany)|pedicel]]s (sessile) and the [[Calyx (botany)|calyx]] is tubular-campanulate in shape, being slightly curved and 1.2&nbsp;cm long. The calyx is glabrous except for the inside surface of the teeth, having 10 veins with the accessory veins inconspicuous. The 2–3&nbsp;mm long calyx teeth are ovate-triangular in shape and are subequal or the posterior teeth larger, with rigid apices. The corollas have some darker purple tinted veins inside; they are 1.2&nbsp;cm long with silky-lanate hairs but bases that are glabrous. The corolla tubes are about 6&nbsp;mm long with the upper lip ovate in shape with entire margins; the lower lips are subpatent with the middle lobe broadly ovate in shape, lateral lobes oblong. The [[stamen]] filaments are densely villous from the base to the middle. The styles are exserted much past the corolla. There are immature nutlets without hairs, brown in color and oblong in shape.<ref>[http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=2&taxon_id=200020441  lanata in Flora of China @ efloras.org<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref></ref>

==Description== It is a shrub that grows up to 2m high, occasionally reaching 5m. The foliage is sticky and smells pleasantly aromatic. The plant is [[deciduous]] and multi-stemmed while the branches are semi-[[succulent]]. The leaves are simple, large, heart-shaped and opposite. They are also coarsely toothed, thick-haired and sticky, and are 35–80&nbsp;mm long. Leaves that are crushed have a [[ginger]] scent. Both sides are covered with a thin dark red lint.  The [[inflorescence]]s are [[branch]]ed, large bunches at the ends of the shoots. About three millimeters in diameter and would appear in veins, the flowers range in color from white to [[Lilac (color)|lilac]], and pink flowers are also found. Male flower spikes have more of the "mist" effect than the female flowers which tend to be more compact. Flowering occurs only in [[subtropical]] or [[temperate climate]]s in wintertime (June–August) when the plant is bare, in the top section of the branches, coinciding with the [[frost]].<ref>Sudhanshu Saxena, Neerja Pant, D.

==Description== [[Image:PuririLeaves.jpg|thumb|right|The lush palmate leaves of a young pūriri]] The pūriri tree can grow up to 20 m tall, with a trunk commonly up to 1.5 m in diameter, frequently thicker, and a broad spreading crown.<ref name=":3">Muriel Fisher, E.

Eagles (1986) Trees and shrubs of New Zealand; Volume one revised.</ref> but can also be very flaky. Pūriri was actively and selectively logged in the past to provide timber for a wide range of end uses. Only the best trees were felled, leaving the gnarled pūriri often found on farm paddocks. This has given the impression that pūriri is incapable of growing straight, but early reports of pūriri describe naturally clear boles of 15 to 30 feet (4.5 to 9 m)<ref name=":5">R. Taylor (1848) Names and properties of the principal New Zealand trees. New Zealand Journal 299 (From the Annals of the [[Anglican Diocese of Auckland|Diocese of New Zealand]]).</ref> and there are still a few trees like that left.  A good example of a well-shaped tree is behind Ruapekapeka Pā in Northland.  The dark green glossy leaves of pūriri are [[palmate]] with usually 5 leaflets, or sometimes three. The lowest two leaflets are smaller than the other three. The leaflets have domatia, little pockets where the mid vein and branching veins meet, which can house arthropods. The underside and veins are a lighter green.<ref>Rae West (1962) Nature in New Zealand. A guide to trees.</ref> Seedling leaves are much more delicate and a lighter green with serrations along the edge.<ref name=":1" /> Seedling pūriri can be confused with seedlings of the [[kohekohe]], or ''Dysoxylum spectabile''; the most obvious difference is that pūriri leaflets originate from one point, whereas kohekohe leaflets are spread along the stalk. The branches of pūriri, especially the young ones, are square in cross-section.  [[Image:Big Puriri  .jpg|thumb|left|200px|A large pūriri near [[Ruapekapeka]], [[Northland Region|Northland]]]] Pūriri is one of the few native trees with large colourful flowers. Many plants in New Zealand have white or green flowers. The tubular flowers of the pūriri look rather like snapdragon flowers<ref>Bruce Hamlin (1970) Nature in New Zealand. Native trees.</ref> and can range from fluorescent pink to dark red, rose pink (most common) or sometimes even to a white flower with a yellow or pink blush. The bright colour, the tube shape, copious nectar production and the hairs at the base of the flower tube all point towards birds pollinating this flower (the hairs stop insects from stealing the nectar). On the New Zealand mainland there is often plenty of nectar in the flowers because there aren't enough birds to eat all the nectar produced by the tree.  The flower has 4 lobes (made of 2 petals), 4 long [[stamen]] (the male part of the flower) and the style grows to be as long as the stamen after the pollen has shed. It is interesting to see how the flowers open. The petals overlap each other in the bud form. The growing stamen push the petals open. When the flower is fully open the style starts growing and reaches its full length just after the anthers on the stamen have shed all the pollen. The flowers occur in loose clusters of up to 12 flowers per cluster.  Some flowers can be found on the pūriri all year round, though it does flower most heavily over winter. Ripe fruit can also be found all year round, but is more common over the summer. Pūriri is a very important tree for native birds in the top half of the [[North Island]] because it provides a constant year-round food supply. Flowers and fruit are carried at the tips of the branches.[[Image:PuririFlowers.jpg|thumb|right|Pūriri may bear flowers throughout the year]][[File:  (Puriri) flower.JPG|thumb|right|Pūriri flower]] [[Image:Lucens019.jpg|thumb|right|A young tree with fruit]] [[File: Lucens- Pururi nuts-seeds 20170423.jpg|thumb|Pūriri nuts from a single tree vary in size and shape]] [[File: Lucens- Pururi nut-seeds top 20170423.jpg|thumb|Viewed from the top of the nut (endocarp) a hole is seen formed from the four seed chambers.]] The fruit or drupe is a bright red (usually) to a pale yellow (rarely, and only on white flowered trees) "cherry". It can grow as big as a cherry, but it is unpleasantly astringent. When broken, the fruit has a bright thin juice, and a faint grape smell. Pūriri fruit is not the most nutritious sort in the New Zealand bush (high in carbohydrates, not lipids, sugars or calcium), but it is always there. The nut ([[Fruit anatomy|endocarp]]) inside the drupe is a very hard pear-shaped kernel<ref name=":2" /> that can contain up to 4 seeds. The seedlings from one kernel can germinate at the same time or be spread over a year.<ref name=":1" /> The nut has four apertures in the endocarp each guarded by an oval door and each leading to a seed chamber.  The Pūriri is self-fertile with self-fertilization ([[autogamy]]) possible. Seed production in 12 samples ranged from 8% to 45% with usually only 1 or 2 live seeds in a fruit. Low seed production is due to inefficiencies in pollination, as well as breakdown of apparently fully developed seeds. The factors controlling germination and opening of the doors are unknown, and most seed would appear to perish within the Imprisoning nut.<ref></ref>
