==Description== '' '' is a [[rhizome|rhizomatous]] perennial herb producing low-lying or climbing stems up to 40 centimeters long, and hairless and waxy in texture. The small leaves are up to 2 centimeters long, lobed, and generally triangular in shape.  The [[inflorescence]] produces flowers at the end of [[Peduncle (botany)|peduncles]] a few centimeters long. The white funnel-shaped flower is typical of morning glories and reaches up to 4 centimeters wide. The bracts form at the base of the peduncle and are short and rounded with an indented tip, usually only partially obscuring the calyx.  The species is most similar to ''[[ occidentalis]]'' which can occur in the same region occasionally. However that species differs in longer, more strongly pointed bracts, and the fact that those bracts form several millimeters below the peduncle on the stem. Additionally ''C. occidentalis'' generally has more triangular leaves with less distinct lobing.

==Description== It is a [[perennial plant|perennial]], [[herbaceous]] [[liana]] growing to a height of 5–30 m tall with twining stems. The [[leaf|leaves]] are entire or three-lobed, 5–15&nbsp;cm long, with a 5–20&nbsp;cm long stem. The [[flower]]s are fragrant, white or pink, and large, 8–14&nbsp;cm diameter. The flowers open quickly in the evening and last through the night, remaining open until touched by the morning dew. On overcast days, the blossoms may remain open for longer.  The flowers also tend to remain open longer during cool temperatures - which may also cause the segments to snag or tear as they open.  The name moonflower derives from their blooming in the evening and their being round in shape like a full moon.

==Description== This is a vigorous vine with stems growing up to 20 feet long. It has large, tuberous roots and white-and-pink flowers that bloom at night.<ref name=":0" /> The leaf shape is highly variable, ranging from triangular to palmate.<ref></ref><ref name=":0" /> The seed capsules contain 3-5 pubescent seeds.<ref name=":0" />  
==Description== [[File:Morning glory in Hiragagakuendai inzai.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Flower close-up]] Native to [[Central America]] and [[Mexico]], the plant is a [[vine|climber]] with twining stems up to 5 m long and is dense to scattered with long hairy [[trichomes]]. The finely hairy, [[emerald green]] leaves are [[Glossary of botanical terms#ovate|ovate]] to almost circular, 5 to 14 cm long. The base is heart-shaped, the edge is entire or lobed three to five times, the leaf lobes are pointed or tapering. The leaves are very similar to those of ''[[ hederacea]]''.  The funnel-shaped, colorful flowers (blue to reddish-purple, with whitish tube) are quite showy and are individually up to five in often dense [[cymose]] groups, in which fully developed flowers and developing buds stand together. The wild forms are smaller than cultivated forms, and are almost always blue; the cultivated forms come in a wide variety of colors.<ref name=":0" /> They open in the morning and close by the afternoon. The long, [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|thorn]]y hairy sepals have a length of 15 to 25 mm, they are long, [[lanceolate]], and have a linear-lanceolate tip. The [[crown (botany)|crown]] is blue, purple, or almost scarlet red. The throat is often colored white. The crown tube has a length of 3 to 5 cm, the crown hem has a width of 4 to 5 cm.  The fruits are almost spherical to spherical capsule fruits with a diameter of 8 to 12 mm. The seeds are pear-shaped and densely covered with short trichomes.  
==Description==   ===Flowers===  The [[flower]]s are solitary and axillary. The linear-subulate [[bracteole]] is 10 to 15&nbsp;mm long and 0.5 to 1&nbsp;mm wide. The rather club-shaped [[Peduncle (botany)|peduncle]] has a length of up to 15&nbsp;mm. The flower is hermaphroditic and displays [[Symmetry in biology#Radial symmetry|fivefold radial symmetry]]. The five unequal, often pink [[sepal]]s are up to 15&nbsp;mm long, ovate to ovate-lanceolate, acuminate and subaristate. The five mauve to violet [[petal]]s are narrowly funnel-shaped, and 2.3 to 5&nbsp;centimetres long. There is only a single ring of five [[stamens]]. The plant flowers during the summer.  ===Fruit and seeds===  The spherical (globose), straw-coloured, smooth [[capsule (botany)|capsule]] has a diameter of approximately 6&nbsp;mm.<ref name="Comp" /> The [[seed]]s are up to 4&nbsp;mm long, densely appressed, pubescent,<ref name="Comp" /> velvety-tomentose with grayish [[Trichome|hair]].  
==Description== ''I. '' is a twining and scrambling vine that can reach  long and wide. The stamens form a white boss in the middle of the throat. The flowers open in the morning and begin to fade by midday, but last longer in cloudy weather. They are followed by [[Capsule (botany)|capsules]] containing two to four flat seeds which are noticeably hairy along their outer edges.<ref name=Illinois/>
