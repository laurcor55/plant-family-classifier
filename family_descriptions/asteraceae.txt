==Description== Diffuse knapweed is an [[annual plant|annual]] or [[biennial plant]], generally growing to between 10 and 60&nbsp;cm in height. It has a highly branched stem and a large [[taproot]], as well as a basal rosette of [[leaf|leaves]] with smaller leaves alternating on the upright stems. [[Flower]]s are usually white or pink and grow out of urn-shaped [[Head (botany)|heads]] carried at the tips of the many branches. Diffuse knapweed often assumes a short rosette form for one year, reaching maximum size, then rapidly growing and flowering during the second year. A single plant can produce approximately 18,000 [[seeds]].<ref>Harris, P., and R. Cranston. 1979. An economic evaluation of control methods for diffuse and spotted knapweed in western Canada.

''The Botanical Explorer''.</ref> and named in honor of its discoverer.  Although locally abundant at some small sites, the species is highly endangered due to a near complete loss of its original habitat.  Morphological and genetic analysis suggests that the metapopulations of ''C. '' may actually represent distinct taxa which may have arisen from genetic bottle-necking and subsequent long-term, island-like biogeographic isolation.  Kris DeLaney (1951-*) has discovered many other new species of plants in central Florida, including a second golden aster, ''C. highlandsensis'' (Highlands County goldenaster).

==Description== Pitcher's thistle is a plant of modest appearance through much of its lifespan; it concentrates most of its biomass in a massive [[taproot]] that can be 6 feet (2 m) in length.  Its long, narrow, gray-green leaves are protected by spines and dense, silvery hairs.  Between 2 and 8 years after germination, the juvenile thistle abruptly matures and sends forth a flower stalk of 100&nbsp;cm (40 inches) or more in height.  At the top of the blooming shoot is a spectacular effusive [[flower head]], ranging in color from creamy white to very light pink, and guarded by spines.  Some individuals may be quite bushy, and produce numerous flowering heads.  Usually at least 5 years are required for the thistle to reach maturity.  Pitcher's thistle is [[monocarpic]]; after flowering once, the plant dies.  Most of its seeds do not disperse very far, in fact, entire heads are occasionally buried, producing clusters of seedlings.<ref>[http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon_id=250066392 Flora of North America, Dune or sand-dune thistle, '' '' (Torrey ex Eaton) Torrey & A.

The tongues are reversely ovate shaped, have a length of usually 20 to 35 (16 to 40) mm and a width of usually 12 to 20 (8 to 25) mm. The tips are almost dull and have three broad, wavy teeth. Below that, they are greatly rejuvenated. In the center of the flower baskets is a large number of tubular flowers (also called disc florets), whose overgrown petals are yellow, turn white in the lower part and reach a length of 5 to 6 mm. The anthers are brownish-black and about 3 mm long, at the tips are short-triangular, translucent attachments with a length of 0.5 to 0.8 mm. The branches of the stylus are short and rather dull, with a length of 0.5 mm.<ref>Thomas E. Melchert  . In: Dorothy L. Nash, Louis O. Williams (ed.): Flora of Guatemala. In: Fieldiana: Botany.

==Description== This species of '''' is considered a [[half-hardy]] [[annual plant|annual]], although plants may re-appear via self-sowing for several years. Its foliage is [[Opposite (botany)|opposite]] and [[pinnate]]ly divided. The plant height varies from 1–7 feet (30–210 cm). The original and its cultivars appear in shades of yellow, orange, and red. It is especially popular in [[Korea]] and [[Japan]], where it is often seen in mass plantings along roadsides, following an initiative pursued by the Korean-Japanese botanist [[Woo Jang-choon]].

==Description== It is a small annual herb that produces lanceolate, alternate, wooly leaves and peg-shaped flowerheads in terminal clusters. The seeds are windborne.  
==Description== The [[flower]]s are yellow-to-orange, and born on distinctively setose-to-ciliate (hairy) [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]]s.  The flower's [[involucre]] is glabrous and a sub-cylindrical shape, with a fleshy truncate base.   The [[involucre]] bracts/scales are a distinguishing characteristics of this species. At the top of the involucre, it usually has two or three rows of terminal scales. These are finely acuminate and the margins of the inner row are distinctly ciliate. Along the length of the involucre, it can also have several parietal scales, which are usually deltoid acuminate and somewhat arranged in a row around the involucre (a characteristic shared with ''[[ linearis]]'').   The leaves are linear or linear-lanceolate, and can be either simple or [[Pinnation|pinnate]]. The upper leaf surface is usually rough and the lower surface is tomentose (white woolly). There are usually cilia/hairs along the lower leaf margins.   In its growth form, ''G. '' is a compact herbaceous perennial, and forms basal rosettes with only relatively short stems. The bases of old dead leaves usually do not persist around the stem as they do in ''[[ linearis]]''.<ref>Mucina, L., Howis, S. & Barker, N. (2009).

==Description== Santa Cruz tarplant is an annual wildflower that can grow to 50&nbsp;cm tall, but is often much smaller.  The flowering period is June to November.  The growth habit is a single erect stem with larger specimens developing branches. Its leaves are [[leaf shape|linear]] and manifest longer near the plant base. The lower ranging leaves exhibit sharp, short teeth at their edges, while the upper leaves present edges that are rolled back, leading to a bristly feeling.  Several other species have a similar general appearance, and can be easily mistaken for the Santa Cruz tarplant.  The real Santa Cruz tarplant, though, has distinctive glands (see photos) that are not present in lookalikes.  [[File:Santa cruz tarplant, distinctive glands.jpg|thumb| , commonly known as Santa Cruz tarweed, illustrating distinctive glands]]  [[File:Santa Cruz tarplant, gland zoom.jpg|thumb|Zoom view of distinctive glands, one circled in red.]]  The aroma of the plant has variously been described as strong, [[citrus]]y, [[tangerine]] and [[Christmas tree]]-like. The pungent smell protects it by repelling many would-be feeders.  It has characteristic yellow [[Bellis perennis|daisy]]-like flowers, with black [[anther]]s giving the appearance of striking black dots in the flower center.  It is distinguished by its large number of flowers: 8 to 16 three-lobed outer ray flowers and 40 to 90 central disk flowers, more than any others in the genus ''[[]]''. The flowers are situated in dense clusters at the branch tips or along the branch on a very short stem.  ;Drought tolerance The Santa Cruz tarplant has an extremely long [[tap root]], allowing it to thrive longer into the season than most coastal [[wildflower]]s. The plant produces [[Soil seed bank|seedbanks]], which may not germinate in the next season, but which can remain viable over a period of years. Blooming season is summer, when there is less competition for [[pollinator]]s and also less competition for sunlight, since in its range many plants have died back from the summer drought. Further protection from the rainless summer is a resinous coating on leaves and stems, allowing retention of water until late in the season. These resins often adhere to livestock, and, in the case of facial adherence, lead to a [[mascara]]-like effect after dust adheres to the resin in turn.

Leaves are small (50mm x 3mm), slender, terete, succulent and triangular. They exude a strong smell if damaged.  The flower capitula appears in Spring and has yellow ray florets. It is large, solitary and appears in among the leaves (not held up freely in an inflorescence of numerous flowers, as in ''[[ aloides]]'').  ===Related species=== Several related and similar looking species occur in the region, such as ''[[ aloides]]'' and ''[[ sarcoides]]''.  The flower clusters of ''[[ aloides]]'' are held up on an inflorescence, above the leaves.  Those of ''[[ sarcoides]]'' are on pedicels that are of a similar length to the leaves.  ===Distribution=== This species favours clay soils in dry [[Karoo]] areas of the [[Western Cape]] and [[Northern Cape]] Provinces, [[South Africa]].

==Description== Plants in the genus ''[[]]'' consist of [[annual plant|annuals]], perennials and subshrubs, ranging from anywhere between . The bract below the flower, or phyllary, are around 11–66 in number and can either be condensed or broad. In '' '', the phyllaries are around 21-43 and are arranged subequally to equal.  ''[[]]'' have receptacles that tend to be low convex and paleate, essentially having a scaly covering.  Ray florets are essentially the colorful, flowery portion of the plant. In most ''[[]]'', the amount of ray florets can be anywhere between non-existent and as many as 45. They vary in colors, being any mixture of orange-yellow, lemon-yellow, pink, purple, or white.  '' '' tend to have 8-21 ray florets with their colors being orange-yellow, with traces, lining, or fully colored faces of brown or purple.  Disc florets in the overall genus can range anywhere from 12 to 172 in quantity, however, in contrast to ray florets, disc florets are actually fertile, and bisexual as well. Their colors differ on each part of the floret (i.e., the anthers are black or yellow, and the corollas are the same color as the ray florets). In ''S. '', the dis florets are enumerated from around 90–154, with the anthers almost always yellow, scarcely black.  Cypselae are fruits in the  plants that are from inferior ovaries. They tend to be flattened and occasionally hairy. In ''S. '', the cypselae are around 4 – 6&nbsp;mm. In connection with the fruit structures, pappi surround the fruits. Generally absent in ''[[]]'' plants, they are either absent or very fine (4&nbsp;mm) in ''S. '' as well.  
==Description== Hairy leafcup is 0.6 to 3.0 m (24 – 118&nbsp;in) tall. The stem is stout and generally smooth below the [[inflorescence]] branches. The opposite leaves form a small cup around the stem and hence the name leafcup. Each head has 7 to 13 yellow, 1 – 2&nbsp;cm (3/8 to 3/4 in) long [[#Floral heads|ray flowers]] to the outside, and 40-80 or so yellow tube-like disc flowers to the inside. A single large plant may produce one hundred or so heads.

==Description== '' '' is a moderately long-lived perennial with a whitish [[taproot]] and a [[Rosette (botany)|rosette]] of five to eight green leaves, sometimes growing solitarily and sometimes somewhat matted. The leaves are  wide, and have several deep lobes and a long triangular final lobe. The [[inflorescence]]s grow direct from the rosette, each with a long pinkish stem that often curves downwards and has transverse wrinkles. Each flowering stem bears a single flower head consisting of multiple [[florets]] which are bisexual; the [[ligules]] are white or creamy-white and have a purple streak on the underside. The brownish-black fruits have a number of shallow ridges and are capped by white [[Pappus (botany)|pappi]] which form parachutes.<ref name=Svalbard/>  
==Description== This species is very similar to, and often mistaken for, the common dandelion, ''[[ officinale]]''. It most readily differs by its reddish-brown seed bases, unlike the more olive colored seeds of ''T. officinale''. The red-seeded dandelion can also be identified by its leaves, which have consistently triangular lobes throughout, whereas ''T. officinale'' tends to have erratic [[Lobed leaf|lobing]] with minimal or no triangular form. The leaves of ''T. '' thus bear a closer resemblance to the [[basal leaves]] of sow thistles (''[[Sonchus oleraceus]]'').

==Description== [[File:Manitoulin gold 1.jpg|thumb|right]] '' '' is a perennial herb growing from a branching [[caudex]] with one or more erect stems measuring 6 to about 35 centimeters (2.4-14.0 inches) tall. The leaves are located around the base of the plant and have rubbery, glandular blades. The [[inflorescence]] is a single [[Head (botany)|flower head]] borne on a hairy [[Peduncle (botany)|peduncle]]. The head contains 50-250 yellow disc florets surrounded by 7-27 (occasionally 0) yellow ray florets each ray measuring 1 or 2 centimeters (0.4-0.8) in length. The fruit is an [[achene]] tipped with a [[Pappus (flower structure)|pappus]] of scales.<ref name=fna/>  
==Description== Having a [[taproot]], it is extremely resistant to [[drought]], but thrives in rain. The designation greenthread is most appropriate, as it has thin, thread-like leaves. It can be single-stemmed or multi-stemmed, and reaches a height of 12 to 26&nbsp;inches. The leaves are scattered along the whole stem. The [[Bellis perennis|daisy]]-like, 2&nbsp;inch, eight-ray flowers are golden-yellow and the numerous disk flowers are reddish to dark brown. The urn-shaped bloom buds droop downward prior to opening. The inner whorl of [[phyllary|phyllaries]] surrounding the lower portion of the bloom is translucent, which allows the colors of the developing flowers to be seen. When open, there are two types of phyllary at the base of the bloom: one is short and green, the other red and long.  
==Description== It is a perennial herb producing a slender, branching stem 30 to 60 centimeters tall or more. The leaves are narrow, mostly compound with linear or threadlike segments measuring a few centimeters long. The [[inflorescence]] bears several [[Head (botany)|flower heads]] each in a cuplike involucre of [[bract|phyllaries]] with purple-tinged, pointed lobes with white edges. The head contains many yellow or orange disc florets, and sometimes one or more yellow ray florets, although these may be absent.

==Description== [[File: top 1.jpg|thumb|Top view of the flower]] The plant bears daisylike yellow-centered white or yellow flowers with three-toothed ray florets. The leaves are toothed and generally arrowhead-shaped. Its fruit is a hard [[achene]] covered with stiff hairs and having a feathery, plumelike white [[Pappus (flower structure)|pappus]] at one end. Calyx is represented by scales or reduced to pappus. The plant is invasive in part because it produces so many of these achenes, up to 1500 per plant, and each achene can catch the wind in its pappus and be carried some distance. This plant can be found in fields, meadows, croplands, disturbed areas, lawns, and roadsides in areas with tropical or semi-tropical climates. [[File:.JPG|thumb|'' '']]
