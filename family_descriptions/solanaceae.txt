==Description==  Unusually for an '''' species, ''A. '' is a [[shrub]] ('frutex' in the Latin description given in Flora Iranica - of which the following is a translation). Height 120–200&nbsp;cm. Vegetative parts glabrous. Lower stems, in flowering part, more or less  bent in zigzag fashion. Largest of lower leaves to 15.5 x 7.5&nbsp;cm, ovate-lanceolate, widest at base, rarely oblong-lanceolate, rounded-cuneate or broadly cuneate at base, tip finely acuminate lengthwise, arched with lateral veins, blade decurrent into petiole by one fifth to one sixth of its length; lesser lower leaves half to a quarter the size of greater but of similar form, although often with a more rounded base and petioles growing progressively shorter up stem to point where uppermost leaves almost sessile. Upper leaves quickly diminished and narrowed, bases cuneate, the tips finely acuminate, the smaller ones greatly reduced, oblong-lanceolate becoming almost thread-like. Flowers sometimes solitary though often in pairs, the pedicels 1–2&nbsp;cm (average 1.5&nbsp;cm) in length, erect, puberulent-glandulose. Calyx circa 10–12&nbsp;mm in length, set apart from tube of corolla, campanulate, puberulent-glandulose, divided approximately to the middle into triangular-acuminate lobes, the lobes being acuminate to hair-like and outspread-erect,  in the fruiting stage 7–12&nbsp;mm in length, ovate-triangular, outspread-stellate and reflexed. Corolla in the dry state 2-2.5&nbsp;cm in length, more or less funnel-shaped to campanulate-urceolate with a greatly narrowed base, five-lobed (the lobes 6–7&nbsp;mm in length), in texture marked irregularly with pits of ovate form, colour greenish to dirty greenish-yellow. Stamens of unequal length, somewhat exserted, bases of filaments woolly in region where united with lower part of corolla tube. Style longer than corolla. Berry 7–14&nbsp;mm in diameter, globose-flattened, slightly umbonate and ribbed/lined, colour black-ish in the dry state (according to the testimony of [[Joseph Friedrich Nicolaus Bornmüller|Bornmüller]], of a drab, yellow colour). Seeds 1.6–1.7 x 1.2–1.3&nbsp;mm, angular-reniform, reticulate-foveolate (the partitions of the reticulations slightly wavy), of a brownish colour.  Note: it is apparent from the above that Professor Schönbeck-Temesy was writing her description using only dry, herbarium specimens (i.e. had not seen a living specimen of the plant), since the qualification 'in the dry state' (''in sicco'') appears in said description twice - once regarding the average length of the corolla and again in the description of the colour of the berry (which the drying process appears to have changed from yellow to blackish).

==Description== [[File:_bonodora.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The shrubby plant in view.]]   is a 0.2 to 1 m high shrub with strongly [[branch]]ed growth. The branches spring close to the base, are often zigzag-like shaped and covered with leaves. The bark is thin, light brown to greyish. The young branches are light brown, the distance between the [[Internode (botany)|internode]]s is about 1&nbsp;cm.  The leaves vary greatly in their shape, they are almost [[Sessility (botany)|sessile]], the [[petiole (botany)|petiole]] is only 1 to 4&nbsp;mm long, [[glabrousness (botany)|glabrous]] and dark purple colored. The leaf blade is 4 to 9&nbsp;cm long and 2.2 to 5.5&nbsp;cm wide, elliptic to [[Glossary of leaf shapes#oblong|oblong]] or ovate to reverse ovate. To the front, the leaf is pointed, blunted or rounded, occasionally provided with a small tip or bulged. The leaf base is dull to wedge-shaped, rarely cut. The top of the leaf is dull or shiny dark green, the underside is dull and light green. Occasionally there are some fine [[trichome]]s along the [[midrib]]. On each side of the leaf, five to eight side veins extend from the midrib, most of which are straight.  ===Inflorescences and flowers === Even at a height of only 30&nbsp;cm, plants of the species can flower. The terminal, compact inflorescences consist of three to 20 non-fragrant flowers. The inflorescence [[Glossary of botanical terms#Axis|axis]] is 3 to 7&nbsp;mm long and glabrous. Below each flower are one or two [[foliage]]-like bracts, 1 to 10&nbsp;mm long, [[lanceolate]] and [[ciliate]]. The flower stalks are light green, 6 to 8&nbsp;mm long, slender and glabrous or sparse glandular hairy, on the fruit of the stalk thickens.  The calyx is 9 to 13&nbsp;mm long, tubular-bell-shaped, glabrous or slightly glandular hairy, light green and smooth. The [[Calyx (botany)|calyx]] teeth are 2 to 3&nbsp;mm long, upright or bent back, triangular to lanceolate. At the top they are pointed. The chalice is leathery on the fruit, clearly streaked with veins and enclosing the fruit.  The [[crown (botany)|crown]] is initially pale [[purple]], but fades to white. The petal is 15 to 20&nbsp;mm long and 2&nbsp;mm in diameter, about twice as long as the goblet. It is slightly glandular hairy, pale purple at the base, whitening towards the top. The thickening at the transition to the Kronsaum is white, rounded or square. The coronary band itself has a diameter of 20 to 30&nbsp;mm, it is projecting and forms a level. The underside is white. The [[corolla (botany)|corolla]] lobes are almost the same size. The upper part is usually a little smaller, about 5&nbsp;mm long, the tip is almost cut off. The other lobes are about 8&nbsp;mm long and rounded at the top.  The four stamens start in the upper half of the petals and do not extend beyond this. The [[stamen]]s are white, slender and cylindrical, with the upper pair of stamen 2&nbsp;mm; only 1&nbsp;mm long for the other pair. The anthers are about 1&nbsp;mm long, circular-kidney-shaped and brown. The ovary is 2&nbsp;mm high, egg-shaped and pale green. The pen is slim, white and bent at the top. The scar is light green and slightly bilobed, with different sized lobes.<ref>Timothy C. Plowman (Autor), Sandra Knapp, J. R. Press (Hrsg.): A Revision of the South American Species of  ().

They are ovate and pointed at the top, smooth, glabrous and dark green. The [[pericarp]] is thin-walled, drying on maturity, crusty and only springing up late.  Each fruit contains about ten to twelve seeds . These are 5 to 6&nbsp;mm long and measure 3&nbsp;mm in diameter. They are oblong-elliptic and angled. The surface is dark brown and grained like a net. The [[embryo]] is 4&nbsp;mm long, almost straight, the cotyledons are 1.5&nbsp;mm long and ovate.  
==Description== [[File:  shrub.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Shrub setting]] This species is a [[shrub]] up to 2.4 meters tall by 1.5 wide whose bark is greyish brown and mostly smooth and only occasionally interrupted by longitudinal cracks. The sparsely existing branches stand upright to spread. The dark green, smooth branches are strong and [[glabrousness (botany)|glabrous]], rarely covered with fluff-haired or glandular [[trichome]]s.  The leathery leaves are up to 16 centimeters long, dark green on top and paler on the undersides. The leaves are distributed on the branches or as a group at the branch tips. The hairless [[petiole (botany)|petiole]]s have a length of 5 to 12&nbsp;mm. The firmly membranous to almost leathery leaf blade is 6.5 to 16&nbsp;cm long and 2 to 6.5&nbsp;cm wide, elongated to elongate-lanceolate, rarely elliptic-oblong to [[Glossary of botanical terms#ovate|ovate]]-elongated. The tip is pointed to short pointed, rarely blunted to notched. The base of the leaf blade is wedge-shaped to tapered. The leaf surface is glabrous or dotted on the underside of the [[midrib]] or slightly glandular hairy. The top is dark green, dull to shiny, the underside is light green. From the midrib go five to eleven side veins that run straight or in a wide arc.<ref name=fl/>  The four [[stamen]]s set in the upper part of the floral tube, the white stamens are almost circular, somewhat trough-shaped in the direction of the dust bag. The upper pair of stamens has 4 to 6&nbsp;mm long stamens, the lower stamens are 2 to 4&nbsp;mm long. The greenish-brown [[anther]]s are 1.5 to 2&nbsp;mm long and circular to kidney-shaped. The bright green [[ovary]] is 2 to 3&nbsp;mm high and has a diameter of 1.5&nbsp;mm, it is conical-ovate shaped. The thread-like [[stylus]] has a length of 25 to 30&nbsp;mm and is coloured lavender. The scar is bilobed, white, 1&nbsp;mm long, the scar lobes are slightly different in size.<ref>Räty, E. ja Alanko, P. 2004: Viljelykasvien nimistö. Puutarhaliitto.  .

The flower is about 5 centimeters long. It blooms purple with a white throat, then turns lavender and then white. The shrub has all three flower colours at once as more bloom. This plant is toxic, especially the fruit. The inflorescences are [[Inflorescence#Terminal flower|terminal]], are sitting or almost sitting and consist of one to eleven flowers . Each flower is supported by one to three foliage-like [[bract]]s, which are 1 to 8&nbsp;mm long, linear-lanceolate, concave and narrowly pointed. They may be glabrous or glandular. The plant blooms from autumn to early summer. The flowers are on 11 to 25 (rarely to 35) mm long, vigorous [[pedicel (botany)|flower stem]]s, which are upright, towards the tip are slightly wider, hairy or slightly glandular hairy.<ref>Zuloaga, FO, O.

==Description== ===Vegetative characteristics=== Like all other species of the genus '''', plants of the species '' '' grow as a shrub, but sometimes as climbing plants. They grow into four-meter woody plants relatively quickly, and live up to 15 years, which gives them, especially with age, an almost tree-like appearance.<ref></ref>  
==Description== '' '' is a slender evergreen that reaches seven feet in height. Overall, the structure is very compact with only a few branches. The panicles form in closely compacted groups at the top of the plant. Downy, [[pendulous]], hairy shoots carry simple, alternate oblong leaves with pointed tips.<ref name=Guide74 /> Leaves are mid green in color and ovate with entire margins. Leaves are arranged alternately on the stem and grow to be eight centimeters long. Leaves also have a distasteful smell, but the flowers smell sweet.<ref name=WeedNZ></ref> Leaves bear funnel-shaped bright purplish-red (almost blood red) flowers with 5 pointed lobes. Flowers are typically 2&nbsp;cm long. Immature stems are densely covered with purplish hairs that become woody as maturity is reached. When grown in warm temperate climates the leaves are soft and hairy. Flowers bloom from August to March.<ref name=PoM12/> Berries can be produced and are crimson to dark red in color. Grows best in a semi-shaded environment, in fertile, non-dense soil. Withstands times of drought.  Pollination occurs through hummingbirds.

==Description== '' '' is a tuberous-rooted, [[subshrub]] that typically reaches a height of 0.6 to 1.5 metres.<ref>  ===Similar species=== '' '' is quite similar to [[ metel|''D. metel'']], to the point of being confused with it in early scientific literature.  ''D. metel'' is a closely related plant, believed until recently to be of [[Old World]] provenance (though now thought to have been brought to Asia from the Antilles no earlier than the sixteenth century) and misconstrued as being referred to in the works of [[Avicenna]] in eleventh century [[Persia]]. [[ stramonium|''D. stramonium'']] differs in having much smaller flowers, seed capsules dehisceing by four distinct valves, and dentate leaves, while the more closely related [[ wrightii|''D. wrightii'']] differs in having wider, 5-toothed (instead of 10-toothed) flowers which are usually pinkish-violet rather than white. ''D. '' differs from ''D. stramonium'', ''D. metel'' & ''D. fastuosa'' in having about 7 to 10 secondary veins on either side of the midrib of the leaf which anastomose by arches at about 1 to 3&nbsp;mm. from the margin. No [[anastomosis]] of the secondary veins are seen in the other 4 major species of ''''.  
==Description== The plant is an annual or short-lived shrubby perennial herb. The roots are a branched tap root, and are not fleshy like roots found in perennial species such as ''[[ innoxia]]'' and ''[[ wrightii]].'' The species can grow up to  Page 41.</ref> that the plant was "...native probably to the mountainous regions of [[Pakistan]] or [[Afghanistan]] westward..." While there now remains no doubt that the species originated in the New World, evidence is mounting that it was introduced to the Indian subcontinent - whether by human agency or some chance natural event is not known - at a date no later than the [[4th century|4th century CE]]. This precedes the first arrival of European explorers in the Americas.<ref name="Geeta & Gharaibeh">Geeta R and Gharaibeh W 2007 Historical evidence for a pre-Columbian presence of  in the Old World and implications for a first-millennium transfer from the New World; J. Biosci. 32 1227–1244.</ref>  A wild form of ''D. '' as a distinct species is unknown. The species, as currently described, is essentially a collection of ancient cultivars likely attributable to pre-Columbian horticultural practices.<ref name="Symon & Haegi" />  === Similarities to ''D. innoxia'' === ''D. '' is similar, in its above-ground parts, to ''D. innoxia'', but, while ''D. '' has almost glabrous leaves and fruits that can be nodding or erect and are warty, rather than spiny; ''D. innoxia'' is pilose (softly hairy) all over and has a markedly spiny, nodding fruit with a more prominently frilled and reflexed persistent calyx.  Symon and Haegi noted in 1991 the occurrence on [[Cuba]] of an apparently wild plant given the name '' velutinosa'' <small>V.R. Fuentes</small><ref>''Revista Jard. Bot. Nac. Univ. Habana'' 1: 53 1980 publ. 1981.</ref> (no longer an accepted species and now listed as a form of ''D. innoxia''), the capsules of which are tuberculate like those of ''D. ''.<ref name="Cavazos Phenetic">Cavazos, M.L., Jiao, M. and Bye, R. Phenetic analysis of  section Dutra ()in Mexico, ''Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society'' (2000), 133: 493-507.</ref>  Historically, single-flowered forms of ''D. '' have frequently been confused with the widely naturalised ''D. innoxia'' - from which it differs in its much less pubescent stems and foliage and shorter-spined and less densely-spined capsules.<ref name="Symon & Haegi" /> The reason for this confusion was finally discovered through genetic research carried out in 2000, where it was determined that ''D. '' is a domesticated form of ''D. inoxia'' that was originally derived from Central America and southeastern Mexico.<ref name="Cavazos Phenetic" />  In support of this claim regarding domestication, Cavazos et al. list several pieces of evidence. While the flowers of wild  species are usually white or pale, thin in texture, single and short-lived, the flowers of ''D. '' have several distinctive strong colour forms, are thick in texture, often have double or triple flowers (trumpet-like corollas nested one within the other) and can last for up to a week before withering. Additionally, the seed capsules of wild '''' species are usually clad with sharp spines which protect them from premature predation, while those of ''D. '' bear short, sparse spines or tubercles. It is also found that regrowth of the perennial wild species sprouts from the top of the thick roots below ground level, while in ''D. '' such regrowth is sub-shrubby, sprouting from the woody stem base. It is those woody stems that are used in the vegetative propagation of this 'species' in the indigenous horticulture of southern Mexico. In the light of such evidence, it appears highly likely that humans have in the past undertaken selective breeding of the species ancestral to ''D. '' to produce mutant forms that flower for longer, have colourful corollas of curious shapes, fruits that lack hurtful spines and somewhat shrubby stems that lend themselves readily to the taking of cuttings.<ref name="Cavazos Phenetic" />  ===Cultivars=== [[File: 'Blackcurrant Swirl' at night IMG 8614-2.jpg|thumb|''D.

Its flowers normally have a double or triple corolla, each corolla having a deep purple exterior and white or off-white interior. The same double or triple corolla is also a feature of the yellow-flowered cultivar 'Chlorantha'. The purple-flowered 'Fastuosa' has been reported to have become [[Naturalisation (biology)|naturalised]] in Israel, where it may yet become as common a roadside weed as the related ''D innoxia''.  ''D.

==Description== [[File:jasminoides.jpg|200px|thumb|left|A close-up of the flower.]] The jasmine-flowered nightshade is a woody climber that forms branches 2 to 8 m long and has a base that can reach more than 10 centimeters in diameter. Fast-growing, it climbs by winding the [[leaf stalk]]s around supports. The [[shoot]] axes are strongly angled zigzag, hairless or in the youth stage with simple, white, single-row [[trichome]]s less than 0.5 millimeters in length. New growth is hairless or finely to sparsely hairy. The bark of older branches is green or reddish green or, if the plant grows in direct sunlight, often purple-green. The ovate or ovate-lanceolate leaves are 30 to 50 mm long and 15 to 25 mm wide. The [[sympodial]] units contain many leaves. These are usually simple, only very rarely divided with one to four irregular lobes and pinnately split.   ===Inflorescences=== The white or pale blue flowers appear in groups of around 20 in branched inflorescences, produced in profusion in the spring but also sporadically at other times of the year. The [[inflorescence]]s are initially terminal, later also laterally. They are hairless, reach lengths of 5 centimeters and more, are usually divided two or three times, but can also be divided significantly more often and contain up to 50 flowers. All flowers are fully developed and five-fold. The inflorescence stalk becomes 0.5 to 4 centimeters long, but its length is very variable depending on the size of the inflorescence and the age.   These are followed by dark blue or black berries that are around 8 mm in diameter.<ref name=sa/>
