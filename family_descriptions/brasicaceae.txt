==Description== It is an [[herbaceous]] [[biennial plant]] growing from a deeply growing, thin, whitish taproot scented like [[horseradish]]. In their first years, plants are [[Rosette_(botany)|rosettes]] of green leaves close to the ground; these rosettes remain green through the winter and develop into mature flowering plants the following spring. Second-year plants often grow from </ref> called a [[silique]], green maturing to pale grey brown, containing two rows of small shiny black [[seed]]s which are released when a silique splits open. A single plant can produce hundreds of seeds, which often scatter several meters from the parent plant.  Depending upon conditions, garlic mustard flowers either [[Autogamy|self-fertilize]] or are [[cross-pollinated]] by a variety of insects. [[File:Garlic Mustard close 800.jpg|thumb|Close-up of garlic mustard flowers]] [[File: seeds.jpg|thumb|right|garlic mustard seeds]]  Sixty-nine insect herbivores and seven fungi are associated with garlic mustard in Europe. The most important groups of natural enemies associated with garlic mustard were [[weevil]]s (particularly the genus ''[[Ceutorhynchus]]''), [[leaf beetles]], [[butterflies]], and [[moths]], including the [[larva]]e of some moth species such as the [[garden carpet]] moth.<ref name="Garlic Mustard"/> The small white flowers have a rather unpleasant aroma which attracts [[midge]]s and [[hoverfly|hoverflies]], although the flowers usually pollinate themselves. In June the pale green caterpillar of the [[Anthocharis cardamines|orange tip butterfly]] (''Anthocharis cardamines'') can be found feeding on the long green seed-pods from which it can hardly be distinguished.<ref name="Reader 2001"/>

==Description== [[File: .jpg|thumb|left|Leaves of ''B. '']] This mustard is native to the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East. It became notorious during the twentieth century after it invaded the deserts of the United States and Mexico. Recently it has become an abundant weed of low deserts including the [[Sonoran Desert|Sonoran]] and [[Mojave Desert]]s, plus the desert valleys such as the [[Coachella Valley|Coachella]] and [[Imperial Valley (California)|Imperial Valleys]] of southern California.<ref name="ecoseeds.com">Dremann, Craig. 2005. California desert and adjacent States Megatransect Survey for the Saharan Mustard, mile-by-mile.

When the seed coats are moistened they form a gel and become very sticky and readily adhere to people, animals, and objects. Seeds easily take hold along roadsides and arid desert lands, especially in disturbed habitats. The plant disperses 750 to 9000 seeds which stay viable for several years in soil, contributing to its status as an invasive species.<ref name="mahajan"></ref>

The flower closes its petals in late afternoon as the sun goes down and nods its pedicel before a rain, protecting the pollen.<ref name=Ariyoshi/>  Hand pollination of two milkmaids populations in the [[San Francisco Presidio]] improved seed set from 8% to 85%, with seeds ripening in about 53 days.<ref name=Ariyoshi/>  
==Description== The vegetative parts of this plant, which can reach 20–40&nbsp;cm, arise from a segmented [[rhizome]]. The leaves are on long [[petiole (botany)|petiole]]s, deeply and palmately dissected into five segments with large "teeth" on the margins. The white to pinkish [[flower]]s are held above the foliage in a spike. [[Fruit]] is an elongated pod which can be up to 4&nbsp;cm long.<ref name="LBJ-wildflower-center" /><ref name=":0"></ref> Its native habitats include rich woods, wooded bottomlands, limestone outcrops, and rocky banks and bluffs.<ref name="LBJ-wildflower-center" />  
==Description== New Zealand bittercress was described by Hooker as “a small and very distinct species of '''', wiry and fragile in every part’’.<ref name=Hooker/>  The plant has a low and spreading growth habit with unbranched stems which creep along the ground.  It produces daughter plants through rooting at the nodes.  The basal, compound [[leaf|leaves]] have three to five leaflets, with the terminal leaflet being up to twice as large as the lateral ones.<ref name=post/>  
==Description== A member of the , it is typified by a four petal flower which blooms in a cluster on a single stalk above a single pair of toothed stem leaves each divided into three broad leaflets. After flowering, narrow seedpods appear just below the flower cluster. It grows approximately 30&nbsp;cm (12&nbsp;in) tall.  
==Description== This is a small flowering plant growing to a height of no more than 30&nbsp;cm, usually perennial, with few short, erect stems. The leaves pinnate, mostly at the base, each with about 5 pairs of rounded leaflets. [[Flower]]s very small, white, 3 – 4&nbsp;mm across with 6 [[stamen]]s. [[Fruit]]s generally not overtopping the flowers - a feature distinguishing it from ''[[ hirsuta]]''.<ref name="Clapham">Clapham, A.R., Tutin, T.G. and Warburg, E.F. 1968.

'' may complete two generations in a year, one in the spring and one in the fall; also depending on the climate, the seeds may [[germinate]] in the fall and the plants may remain green throughout the winter before flowering in the spring. It often grows a [[rosette (botany)|rosette]] of leaves at the base of the stem, while there may be leaves on the upright stem, most of the leaves will be part of the basal rosette. The leaves in this rosette are pinnately divided into 8–15 leaflets which have short stems connecting them to the petiole. These basal leaves are often 3.5–15&nbsp;cm long. The leaflets are round to ovate in shape and may have smooth or dentate edges. The leaflet at the tip of the leaf (terminal leaflet) will be larger than the other leaflets and round to [[reniform]] in shape. The cauline (attached to the upright stem) leaves are also pinnately divided, with fewer leaflets, and generally smaller than the basal leaves; these leaves will be borne on a [[petiole (botany)|petiole]] and are 1.2–5.5&nbsp;cm long. The stems, petioles, and upper surfaces of the cauline leaves are sparsely hairy.  [[File: 6pl.jpg|thumb|left|Fruits]]Plants of this species are usually erect and grow to no more than about </ref>
